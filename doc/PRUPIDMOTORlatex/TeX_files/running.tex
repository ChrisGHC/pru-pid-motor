\chapter{Running the Project}

In order to run the project and hear audio from the speaker, the following steps must have been completed:

\begin{itemize}
	\item ``make'' run in XXXX repository directory.  Some warnings or errors may be ignored.  Check that the C code files pruadc0.c and pruadc1.c compile and firmware files are copied to /lib/firmware.
	\item Run command 
	
	\begin{verbatim}
	prumodout
	\end{verbatim} 
	
	at the command line.  Note that this command may cause some errors or warnings to be emitted.
	This is normal and depends on the current state of the remoteproc kernel driver.
	\item Run command 
	
	\begin{verbatim}
	prumodin
	\end{verbatim} 
	
	at the command line.
	\item XXX
	\item  Finally, the user-space program is ready to be started!
	
	\begin{verbatim}
	cd user_space
	./prumsg s 3000
	\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

If all goes well, the motor should begin turning.

The PRU firmwares will continue to run.  To stop them, issue the command

\begin{verbatim}
prumodout
\end{verbatim}

at the command line, and the PRUs will be halted.
