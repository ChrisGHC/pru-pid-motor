PRU-ICSS PID Motor Demo

DESCRIPTION
This design demonstrates simple motor control with a PID
feedback loop using the Programmable Real Time Unit
Subsystem and Industrial Communication Subsystem (PRU-ICSS).
The PRU-ICSS can be found on several TI processors, such as
AM335x, AM437x, and AM57x; here Sitara AM335x is used on the
BeagleBone Black.
